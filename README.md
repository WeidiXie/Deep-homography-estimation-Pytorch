# Deep homography estimator (work in progress)

This is an implementation of the paper "Deep Image Homography Estimation", by Daniel DeTone, Tomasz Malisiewicz and Andrew Rabinovich
      
      "A deep convolutional neural network forestimating  the  relative  homography  between  a  pair  of  images.
      Our  feed-forward  network  has  10  layers, takes  two  stackedgrayscale images as input, 
      and produces an 8 degree of freedomhomography  which  can  be  used  to  map  
      the  pixels  from  thefirst  image  to  the  second." Abstract
