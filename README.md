# Deep homography estimator (work in progress)

This is an implementation of the paper "Deep Image Homography Estimation", by Daniel DeTone, Tomasz Malisiewicz and Andrew Rabinovich: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03798.pdf
      
      "A deep convolutional neural network forestimating  the  relative  homography  between  a  pair  of  images.
      Our  feed-forward  network  has  10  layers, takes  two  stackedgrayscale images as input, 
      and produces an 8 degree of freedomhomography  which  can  be  used  to  map  
      the  pixels  from  thefirst  image  to  the  second." Abstract
